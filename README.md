# Smart-Cart
HackGSU Spring 2018

# Description
This app is meant for shoppers who are on a budget. A raspberry pi with a camera is set on a shopping cart. Every time the shopper puts in item into the cart, they'll show the bar code to the camera. From the bar code, the app gets the item information like the name and crawl online stores (like Amazon) for prices and will get average price. When the shopper wants to checkout, they'll already know approximately how much their entire cart will cost. The app will also allow user to enter a budget so they can get notified if they go over.
